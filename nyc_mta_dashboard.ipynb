# NYC MTA Dashboard:
## What does access to public transportation look like across the 5 boroughs?

### Introduction

This interactive dashboard uses Plotly and Dash to give an image of access to public transit across New York City's five boroughs. The inspiration behind this is actually the reason I joined MADS; as a graduate in geography specializing in urban development and regional planning, I have long looked for ways to better urban spaces and make them more accessible for the people that live in them. A big driver in urban accessibility, or accessibility anywhere, is the means of transportation available to the public.

Paris, France is now known as the 15-minute city, because you can access schools, pharmacies, banks, public transportation, hospitals, supermarkets, and restaurants within 15 minutes of any point. This has been proven to improve quality of life across multiple aspects, including more resilient local economies, reduced traffic, and access to educational and cultural resources.

While New York City is more than 10x larger than Paris, the possibility exists to imagine a 30-minute city in the same vain, and it is my belief that access to public transportation is the first step in achieving such a feat. For this reason, I believe that the first step to improving urban planning in New York would be to evaulate the current state of public transportation across the boroughs.

Some questions we will observe and hope to answer are:

- Which neighborhoods have the best and worst access to subway stations?
- How does service change throughout the day?
- Is there a relationship between population density and transit accessibility?
- Are all boroughs created equal as far as access to public transit?

This interactive dashboard combines multiple visualization techniques to tell a comprehensive story about transit equity in one of the world's most transit-dependent cities.

### 1. Visualization Technique (25%)

#### Visualization Types

This dashboard uses four visualization techniques to illustrate a story about New York City public transit accessibility:

**1. Choropleth Map**: This spatial visualization uses color gradients to represent transit accessibility scores across NYC neighborhoods. When it comes to urban planning, maps are always the first way of illustrating patterns across a given geography. The color intensity will depend on the public transit accessibility of an area, with a deeper color showing more access and lighter shades indicating less access.

**2. Bar Chart**: While maps show the "where" of public transit accessibility, bar charts show the "how much." By sorting neighborhoods from highest to lowest on metrics like stations per square mile, the bar charts will give a visual that will highlights the differences between neighborhoods. Bar charts are great for quick comparative analysis, and we'll how neighborhoods stack up against each other. Bar charts work best when we compare a single metric across multiple categories (the categories being neighborhoods).

**3. Line Chart**: Public transit service isn't consistent at all hours of the day; train and bus frequency varies throughout the day and week. With line charts, we can show how service frequency fluctuates across time. In this project's context, we will observe how frequency changes and explore how this may affect residents. This being a classic time series, a line chart is a sure way to measure variables over time.

**4. Scatter Plot with Regression**: This visualization explores relationships between variables. In this case, it will show how transit accessibility correlates with neighborhood characteristics like population density. The regression line will give us a quick visual representative of correlation strength, while the individual points will help notice outliers, like neighborhoods with unusually good or poor transit service relative to their demographic profile.

#### How These Visualizations Complement Each Other

These visualizations complement each other by addressing different dimensions of public transit accessibility:

- **Spatial Dimension**: How is public transit service distributed? (Map)
- **Comparative Dimension**: How does it vary across neighborhoods? (Bar Chart)
- **Temporal Dimension**: When is service available? (Line Chart)
- **Relational Dimension**: How does it relate to population density? (Scatter Plot)

Together, they create a multi-dimensional understanding of public transit accessibility that would be impossible with any single visualization method.
For example, the map might show that a neighborhood has few stations (appearing light-colored), but the line chart might reveal that those stations have very frequent service, painting a more nuanced picture of accessibility.

#### Dashboard-specific Considerations and Interactivity

The dashboard implements several interactive features to enhance exploration:

1. **Borough Filtering**: Users can focus on specific boroughs to compare neighborhoods within the same region.
2. **Station Count Range Selection**: This allows filtering neighborhoods by their level of transit service.
3. **Cross-filtering**: Selecting a neighborhood on the map highlights its data in all other visualizations.
4. **Hover Information**: Detailed metrics appear when hovering over elements in any visualization.

These interactive elements transform static visualizations into an exploratory tool where users can test hypotheses and discover patterns. For instance, a user might wonder if Brooklyn neighborhoods have better service than Queens, and could quickly filter to compare these boroughs.



### 2. Visualization Library (25%)

#### Dashboard Framework and Libraries

This dashboard utilizes **Plotly** and **Dash**:

- **Plotly** is an open-source graphing library that produces interactive, polished graphs.
- **Dash** is a framework for building web applications with Python, built on top of Plotly.

**Creator and License**: Plotly and Dash were created by Plotly Technologies Inc. and are available under an MIT license, making them fully open-source and free to use for both personal and commercial projects.

**Installation**: These libraries can be easily installed via pip:

```bash
pip install plotly dash dash-bootstrap-components
pip install pandas geopandas numpy requests



### 3. Demonstration (50%)

#### Dataset Selection and Data Processing

For this dashboard, we'll use the following datasets:

1. **MTA GTFS Data**: NYC MTA subway routes, stops, and schedules
2. **NYC Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs)**: Geographic boundaries of NYC neighborhoods
3. **NYC Population Data**: Population statistics by neighborhood

### Analysis of Results

The interactive dashboard reveals several important insights about transit accessibility in NYC:

1. **Geographic Disparity**: Manhattan neighborhoods have significantly higher station density than the outer boroughs. This is visible in both the map and bar chart visualizations.

2. **Service Frequency Patterns**: The line chart shows that service frequency peaks during morning and evening rush hours, but some neighborhoods maintain consistent service throughout the day while others see dramatic drops during off-peak hours.

3. **Population-Transit Relationship**: The scatter plot reveals a general correlation between population density and transit accessibility, but with notable exceptions. Some densely populated areas lack adequate transit service, while other less populated areas have excellent access.

4. **Borough-Level Trends**: Manhattan has the highest overall station density, followed by Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. This reflects both historical development patterns and the challenge of serving lower-density outer boroughs.

5. **Transit Deserts**: Several neighborhoods with substantial populations have minimal or no subway service, particularly in eastern Queens and parts of Staten Island. These areas represent potential transit equity issues.

### Implications for Urban Planning

This analysis has several implications for urban planning and public transit policy:

- **Targeted Expansion**: Transit expansion efforts could prioritize high-population areas with poor access (the "transit deserts" identified).

- **Service Optimization**: Some neighborhoods may benefit more from increased service frequency than new stations, particularly during off-peak hours.

- **Complementary Services**: Areas with poor subway access could benefit from enhanced bus service, bike infrastructure, or other complementary mobility options.

- **Development Planning**: Future residential and commercial development should consider existing transit infrastructure to avoid exacerbating accessibility disparities.



### Conclusion

This dashboard demonstrates how multiple visualization techniques can work together to tell a fuller story about public transit accessibility in New York City. The choropleth map provides geographic context, the bar chart enables precise comparisons, the line chart reveals temporal patterns, and the scatter plot explores relationships between variables.

The interactivity of the dashboard enables users to explore the data from different angles, testing hypotheses and discovering patterns that might not be apparent in static visualizations. This approach is valuable not just for transit analysis, but for many urban planning applications where spatial, comparative, temporal, and relational dimensions all matter.

The Plotly and Dash libraries proved to be excellent choices for this project, providing a powerful and flexible framework for creating interactive visualizations without requiring extensive web development knowledge. While there were some performance challenges with the large GTFS dataset, sampling and preprocessing techniques helped overcome these limitations.

Future enhancements to this dashboard could include:

1. Adding bus data for a more complete view of transit accessibility
2. Incorporating walking time to stations (catchment area analysis)
3. Analyzing historical changes in transit access over time
4. Adding demographic data to explore equity dimensions

Doing this project demonstrated the value of interactive, multi-dimensional data visualization for understanding how NYC moves, which could help shape future transit planning decisions.
